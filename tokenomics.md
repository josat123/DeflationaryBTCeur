# Tokenomics - DBTCEUR

## Supply
- **Initial minted**: 700,000,000 DBTCED
- **Target circulating**: 500,000,000 DBTCED
- **Minimal supply (hard floor)**: 250,000,000 DBTCED

## Distribution (suggested)
- 10% Owner / Foundation (vesting multi-year)
- 4% Team (vested)
- 4% Treasury for operations
- 82% Ecosystem & Liquidity (airdrops, LP, staking, marketing)

## Fees & Rewards
- **Transfer fee**: 2% (configurabile via DAO in futuro)
  - 60% of collected fees → distributed proportionally to liquidity providers
  - 30% → long holders distribution (based on locked amounts)
  - 10% → burned (sent to contract and burned per schedule)

## Initial Liquidity Plan (example)
- Sushi: 60,000,000 tokens
- Uniswap: 50,000,000 tokens
- QuickSwap: 50,000,000 tokens
- Curve / other: 40,000,000 tokens

## Vesting & Safeguards
- Owner & team wallets are locked via vesting schedule (multi-month cliffs)
- Treasury wallet controlled by DAO multisig
- Immutable owner fee wallet (0.1% share) set at deploy time
